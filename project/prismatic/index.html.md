The goal of prismatic is to provide color manipulation tools in R, in a
intuitive, low-dependency and functional way.

  - **intuitive** All the working functions are prefixed with `clr_` (**c**o**l**o**r**) allowing for easy autocompletion.
  - **low-dependency** Only depends on [farver](https://github.com/thomasp85/farver).
  - **functional** All functions have consistant inputs and outputs and are thus fully pipeable.
