I will be using [quarto presentations](https://quarto.org/). This is the fifth post, you can find the previous post under the category [slidecraft 101](https://www.emilhvitfeldt.com/blog#category=slidecraft%20101).\n\nDoing my personal slidecrafting sessions I sometimes find little ideas I share on social media. This post is a collection of 7 such nuggets in one place, with the hope that it will stop them from disappearing into the ether.\n\n::: callout-note\nAll slide examples in this post are embedded and you can thus advance the slides.\n:::\n\n## Highlight incremental slides\n\nThe use of [incremental lists](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/#incremental-lists) is a great way to add a little something to a set of slides. It also avoids a wall of text, allowing the presenter to show one bullet at a time. All in all, this is helpful as it can be used to focus the viewers' attention. \n\nAs a reminder, we create an incremental list using the following syntax:\n\n```markdown\n::: {.incremental}\n- thing 1\n- thing 2\n:::\n```\n\nWe can add another class to this div and use it to style it more. \n\n```markdown\n::: {.incremental .highlight-last}\n- thing 1\n- thing 2\n:::\n```\n\nthen we use this to style our list. Below `.current-fragment` refers to the last shown item in the list. Setting the `color: grey` isn't necessary, but it is a way to downplay the \"not-current\" items\n\n```scss\n.highlight-last  {\n  color: grey;\n  .current-fragment {\n    color: #5500ff;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThese together yield these slides:\n\n<iframe class=\"slide-deck\" src=\"_tip-1.html\">\n\n</iframe>\n\n<a href=\"_tip-1.qmd\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"listing-slides btn-links\">{{< fa file >}}qmd<a>\n<a href=\"_tip-1.scss\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"listing-video btn-links\">{{< fa brands sass >}}scss<a>\n\n::: callout-note\nThe ordering and selection do not reflect the author's song preferences.\n:::\n\n## Style menu button\n\nThe menu button you see in the lower left-hand side of the slide. Styling it can be done by setting the `$link-color` sass variable. If you want a different icon, or have it colored differently than `$link-color` you need to specify it directly as the color [is hardcoded into the svg](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/blob/13c916d041b2f83c20855fd24c7bd68d07720981/src/resources/formats/revealjs/quarto.scss#L505). The icon is specified as the background image of `.reveal .slide-menu-button .fa-bars::before`.\n\n```scss\n.reveal .slide-menu-button .fa-bars::before {\nbackground-image: url('data:image/svg+xml,<svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\" fill=\"rgb(42, 118, 221)\" class=\"bi bi-list\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M2.5 12a.5.5 0 0 1 .5-.5h10a.5.5 0 0 1 0 1H3a.5.5 0 0 1-.5-.5zm0-4a.5.5 0 0 1 .5-.5h10a.5.5 0 0 1 0 1H3a.5.5 0 0 1-.5-.5zm0-4a.5.5 0 0 1 .5-.5h10a.5.5 0 0 1 0 1H3a.5.5 0 0 1-.5-.5z\"/></svg>') !important;\n}\n```\n\nTthe color is specified by the `fill=\"rgb(42, 118, 221)\"` part of the svg. But since this is an image, we can use whatever image we want.\n\n```scss\n.reveal .slide-menu-button .fa-bars::before {\nbackground-image: url('https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/512/2163/2163350.png') !important;\n}\n```\n\n<iframe class=\"slide-deck\" src=\"_tip-2.html\">\n\n</iframe>\n\n<a href=\"_tip-2.qmd\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"listing-slides btn-links\">{{< fa file >}}qmd<a>\n<a href=\"_tip-2.scss\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"listing-video btn-links\">{{< fa brands sass >}}scss<a>\n\n## Hiding slides\n\nchanging the [slide visibility](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/advanced.html#slide-visibility) is as simple as setting `visibility=\"hidden\"` attribute to the header of a slide\n\n```markdown\n## Slide Title {visibility=\"hidden\"}\n```\n\nI find this useful when I have to give the same presentation multiple times, and I have a disclaimer or other seasonally important slides. Instead of removing and reinserting the information each time, I just change the attribute. \n\n<iframe class=\"slide-deck\" src=\"_tip-3.html\">\n\n</iframe>\n\n<a href=\"_tip-3.qmd\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"listing-slides btn-links\">{{< fa file >}}qmd<a>\n\n## Hand-styled code chunks\n\nWith a little extra effort, you can create highlighted code chunks. This is different than the code highlighting that comes naturally. In this instance, we are creating an unstyled code chunk, and styling part of the code manually with css classes.\n\nFirst, we write a new css class, I like to call it `.mono`. The important thing is that we set `font-family: monospace;`, but we can do other things, like setting the `font-size`.\n\n```scss\n.mono {\n  font-family: monospace;\n  font-size: 0.9em;\n}\n```\n\nNext, we add our code in a fenced div, with the mono class. you need to use `\\ ` to add leading spaces, and each line ends with 2 spaces to denote newlines\n\n```markdown\n::: mono\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nmtcars |>  \n\\ \\ ggplot(aes(mpg, disp)) +  \n\\ \\ geom_point() +  \n\\ \\ geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", formula = \"y ~ x\")\n:::\n```\n\nTaking it to the next step, you can manually change the formatting of functions using css or css classes, `library([ggplot2]{style=\"color:purple;\"})` would make `ggplot2` purple. This is also a great place to use [css classes](https://emilhvitfeldt.com/post/slidecraft-colors-fonts/#using-css-classes).\n\nWe can take it a step further and use [fragments](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/advanced.html#fragments) to have the code highlighted one bit at a time. Changing the last line to the following\n\n```markdown\ngeom_smooth([method = \"lm\"]{.fragment .highlight-red}, [formula = \"y ~ x\"]{.fragment .highlight-blue})\n```\n\nseperately highlights the code `method = \"lm\"` then `formula = \"y ~ x\"` in red and blue.\n\n<iframe class=\"slide-deck\" src=\"_tip-4.html\">\n\n</iframe>\n\n<a href=\"_tip-4.qmd\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"listing-slides btn-links\">{{< fa file >}}qmd<a>\n\n## Absolute position everything\n\nIt took me too long to realize, but the [absolute](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/advanced.html#absolute-position) class can be used on anything!\n\nYou might have seen the following syntax to place an image anywhere\n\n```markdown\n![](image1.png){.absolute top=200 left=0 width=\"350\" height=\"300\"}\n```\n\nBut you are not restricted in using it with images. The following results in the image you see attached:\n\nI like to use it with text in the following way:\n\n```markdown\n[python is great]{.absolute bottom=\"45%\" left=\"20%\"}\n\n[and so is R]{.absolute bottom=\"0%\" right=\"0%\"}\n```\n\n<iframe class=\"slide-deck\" src=\"_tip-5.html\">\n\n</iframe>\n\n<a href=\"_tip-5.qmd\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"listing-slides btn-links\">{{< fa file >}}qmd<a>\n\n## Showing quarto code\n\nThis one isn't as much a slidecrafting tip, as it is a quarto tip! If you are showing how to do something in Quarto using Quarto you need this tip. In essence what we are working with are [unexcuted blocks](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/execution-options.html#unexecuted-blocks).\n\nAdding a `markdown` cell around what you want to show. Important to use more ticks than any of the inside cells inside\n\nusing double curly brackets to indicate that the code block should not be executed.\n\n`````` markdown\n````` markdown\nThis is **Quarto** code\n\n::: {#a38866b1 .cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n1 + 1\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=1}\n```\n2\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n`````\n``````\n\n## Roundup\n\nI hope you learned a lot! I find myself using these types of themes more and more lately, and I hope that you found it useful!\n\n",
