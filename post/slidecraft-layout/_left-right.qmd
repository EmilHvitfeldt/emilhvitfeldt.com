I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser

Midnights become my afternoons

When my depression works the graveyard shift, all of the people

I've ghosted stand there in the room

But somethin' 'bout it felt like home somehow

And I left my scarf there at your sister's house

And you've still got it in your drawer, even now
