<div class="note">
<p>This code have been lightly revised to make sure it works as of 2018-12-16.</p>
</div>
<p>After attending useR!2017 for the first time, which great pleasure and new connections made. I decided to see if I could extract some of the information available in the public schedule. So as with my last post I’ll do a bit of scraping followed by a few visualizations.</p>
<div id="packages" class="section level2">
<h2>Packages</h2>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidyverse)
## Warning: package &#39;tibble&#39; was built under R version 3.6.2
library(utils)
library(plotly)
library(ltm)
require(visNetwork)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="web-scraping" class="section level2">
<h2>Web scraping</h2>
<p>I found this task easiest with the help of <code>purrr:map()</code>. First we find the full schedules at the following links</p>
<p><a href="https://user2017.sched.com/2017-07-04/overview" class="uri">https://user2017.sched.com/2017-07-04/overview</a> (Tuesday)<br />
<a href="https://user2017.sched.com/2017-07-05/overview" class="uri">https://user2017.sched.com/2017-07-05/overview</a> (Wednesday)<br />
<a href="https://user2017.sched.com/2017-07-06/overview" class="uri">https://user2017.sched.com/2017-07-06/overview</a> (Thursday)<br />
<a href="https://user2017.sched.com/2017-07-07/overview" class="uri">https://user2017.sched.com/2017-07-07/overview</a> (Friday)</p>
<p>then we read the entire page into a tibble along with a <em>day</em> variable.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>day &lt;- c(&quot;Tuesday&quot;, &quot;Wednesday&quot;, &quot;Thursday&quot;, &quot;Friday&quot;)
link &lt;- paste0(&quot;https://user2017.sched.com/2017-07-0&quot;, 4:7, &quot;/overview&quot;, sep = &quot;&quot;)

event0 &lt;- map2_df(link, day,
                  ~ tibble(text = readLines(.x),
                           day = .y))</code></pre>
<p>then with the help of <code>stringr</code> we extract the desired information from the document, following the idiom that “multiple simple regex are better then one complicated one”. I also filtered out most non-talk events.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>events &lt;- event0 %&gt;% 
  filter(str_detect(text, &quot;&lt;span class=&#39;&quot;) | str_detect(text, &quot;&lt;/h3&gt;&quot;),
         !str_detect(text, &quot;REGISTRATION&quot;),
         !str_detect(text, &quot;COFFEE BREAK&quot;),
         !str_detect(text, &quot;LUNCH&quot;),
         !str_detect(text, &quot;WELCOME&quot;),
         !str_detect(text, &quot;Poster&quot;),
         !str_detect(text, &quot;RIOT SESSION&quot;),
         !str_detect(text, &quot;Buses&quot;),
         !str_detect(text, &quot;Dinner&quot;),
         !str_detect(text, &quot;CLOSING&quot;)) %&gt;%
  mutate(time = str_extract(text, &quot;&lt;h3&gt;.{1,7}&quot;), # time
         time = str_replace(time, &quot;&lt;h3&gt; *&quot;, &quot;&quot;),
         id = str_extract(text, &quot;id=&#39;\\S{32}&quot;), # id
         id = str_replace(id, &quot;id=&#39;&quot;, &quot;&quot;),
         name = str_extract(text, str_c(id, &quot;.*&quot;)), # name
         name = str_replace(name, str_c(id, &quot;&#39;&gt;&quot;), &quot;&quot;),
         name = str_extract(name, &quot;^.*(?=( &lt;span))&quot;),
         room = str_extract(text, &#39;vs&quot;&gt;(.*?)&lt;&#39;),
         room = str_replace(room, &#39;vs&quot;&gt;&#39;, &quot;&quot;),
         room = str_replace(room, &#39;&lt;&#39;,&quot;&quot;)) %&gt;% # room
  fill(time) %&gt;%
  filter(!str_detect(text, &quot;&lt;h3&gt;&quot;)) %&gt;%
  dplyr::select(-text)</code></pre>
<p>lets take a look at what we have by now just to see that we have what we want.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>head(events)
## # A tibble: 6 x 5
##   day     time   id                    name                               room  
##   &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;chr&gt;                 &lt;chr&gt;                              &lt;chr&gt;

<p>Now that we have all the information about the different events we can scrape every event page to find its attendees. This following chuck of code might seem a little hard at first, it helps to notice that there is a second tibble inside the big tibble.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>people &lt;- map_df(events$id,
       ~ tibble(attendee = tibble(text = readLines(
         str_c(&quot;https://user2017.sched.com/event-goers/&quot;, .x))) %&gt;%
                filter(str_detect(text, &quot; +&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;)) %&gt;% 
                .$text %&gt;%
                str_split(., &quot;li&gt;&lt;li&quot;) %&gt;% 
                unlist(),
       id = .x) %&gt;%
  mutate(attendee = str_replace(attendee, &quot;(.*?)title=\&quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;),
         attendee = str_replace(attendee, &quot;\&quot;&gt;&lt;(.*)&quot;, &quot;&quot;)) %&gt;%
  filter(!str_detect(attendee, &quot;venue&quot;),
         !str_detect(attendee, &quot;Private&quot;)))</code></pre>

<p>With a data set with this many possibilities the options are quite few, so here I’ll just list a few of the ones I found handy. So first we just do a simple bubble plot, this will be done with <code>left_join</code>’s and <code>count</code> and piped straight into <code>ggplot</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>left_join(events, people, by = &quot;id&quot;) %&gt;%
  count(id) %&gt;%
  left_join(events, by = &quot;id&quot;) %&gt;%
  filter(day == &quot;Friday&quot;) %&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(time, room, size = n)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_bw() +
  scale_size(range = c(5, 20)) +
  labs(title = &quot;useR!2017 Friday schedule&quot;,
       x = &quot;&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2017-07-20-analysing-user-2017-schedule-data/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="700px" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Since both our <code>room</code> and <code>time</code> were simply character vectors, the ordering is not right. This can be fixed by setting the levels correctly. Here I have the ordered vectored for both <code>room</code> and <code>time</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>time_levels &lt;- c(&quot;9:15am&quot;, &quot;9:30am&quot;, &quot;11:00am&quot;, &quot;11:18am&quot;, &quot;11:30am&quot;, &quot;11:36am&quot;,
                 &quot;11:54am&quot;, &quot;12:12pm&quot;, &quot;1:15pm&quot;, &quot;1:30pm&quot;, &quot;1:48pm&quot;, &quot;2:00pm&quot;, 
                 &quot;2:06pm&quot;, &quot;2:24pm&quot;, &quot;2:42pm&quot;, &quot;3:30pm&quot;, &quot;3:45pm&quot;, &quot;4:00pm&quot;, 
                 &quot;4:45pm&quot;, &quot;4:55pm&quot;, &quot;5:00pm&quot;, &quot;5:05pm&quot;, &quot;5:30pm&quot;, &quot;5:35pm&quot;, 
                 &quot;5:40pm&quot;, &quot;5:45pm&quot;, &quot;5:50pm&quot;, &quot;5:55pm&quot;, &quot;6:00pm&quot;, &quot;6:05pm&quot;, 
                 &quot;6:10pm&quot;, &quot;6:15pm&quot;, &quot;6:20pm&quot;, &quot;7:00pm&quot;)
room_levels &lt;- c(&quot;PLENARY&quot;, &quot;2.01&quot;, &quot;2.02&quot;, &quot;3.01&quot;, &quot;3.02&quot;, &quot;4.01&quot;, &quot;4.02&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>and we deal with it with a single mutate like so</p>
<pre class="r"><code>left_join(events, people, by = &quot;id&quot;) %&gt;%
  count(id) %&gt;%
  left_join(events, by = &quot;id&quot;) %&gt;%
  mutate(time = factor(time, time_levels),
         room = factor(room, room_levels)) %&gt;%
  filter(day == &quot;Friday&quot;) %&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(time, room, size = n)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_bw() +
  scale_size(range = c(5, 20)) +
  labs(title = &quot;useR!2017 Friday schedule&quot;,
       x = &quot;&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2017-07-20-analysing-user-2017-schedule-data/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" width="700px" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>another way to visualize it would be to use a stacked bar chart like so</p>
<pre class="r"><code>p &lt;- left_join(events, people, by = &quot;id&quot;) %&gt;%
  count(id) %&gt;%
  left_join(events, by = &quot;id&quot;) %&gt;%
  filter(day == &quot;Thursday&quot;) %&gt;%
  mutate(time = factor(time, time_levels),
         room = factor(room, rev(room_levels))) %&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(time, fill = room, text = name)) +
  geom_bar(aes(weight = n)) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
  labs(title = &quot;useR!2017 Thursday schedule&quot;,
       x = &quot;&quot;)
p</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2017-07-20-analysing-user-2017-schedule-data/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png" width="700px" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>or with a bit of interactivity <code>plotly::ggplotly</code> can be used so that is possible to hover over each event to see name and size.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplotly(p, tooltip = c(&quot;n&quot;, &quot;name&quot;), width = 900, height = 555)</code></pre>

<h3>Network graph</h3>
<p>To make our-self a simple network graph will I be using the <a href="https://github.com/datastorm-open/visNetwork">visNetwork</a> package, which have a lovely vignette. So here first of all to create a manageable graph I’ll subset all the Wednesday talks in room 4.02, which was the “Shiny I” and “Text Mining” block.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>sub_data &lt;- left_join(events, people, by = &quot;id&quot;) %&gt;%
  filter(day == &quot;Wednesday&quot;, room == &quot;4.02&quot;) %&gt;%
  dplyr::select(name, attendee, time)</code></pre>
<p>I this graph I will let each node be a event and let the edges be to which degree they share attendees. So we start</p>
<pre class="r"><code>node_size &lt;- sub_data %&gt;% 
  group_by(name, time) %&gt;%
  summarize(n = n())</code></pre>
<p>to find how many attendees the events share with each other we first find all the different pairs of events with <code>utils::combn</code> function and with <code>purrr</code> and <code>inner_join</code> finds how many they have in common. Since <code>utils::combn</code> gives its result in a matrix we have to fiddle just a bit to our way back to a tibble.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>conn &lt;- combn(node_size$name, 2) %&gt;%
  as.tibble() %&gt;%
  map_int(~ inner_join(sub_data %&gt;% filter(name == .x[1]), 
                       sub_data %&gt;% filter(name == .x[2]), by = &quot;attendee&quot;)
              %&gt;% nrow()) %&gt;%
  rbind(combn(node_size$name, 2)) %&gt;% t() %&gt;% as.tibble()

<p>for the node tibble we need to supply it with a <em>id</em> column, but I will also supply it with a label (name of the event), size (number of people in the event) and color (what book is this event in. green = Shiny I, blue = Text Mining).</p>
<pre class="r"><code>Shiny_I &lt;- c(&quot;11:00am&quot;, &quot;11:18am&quot;, &quot;11:36am&quot;, &quot;11:54am&quot;, &quot;12:12pm&quot;)
Text_Mining &lt;- c(&quot;1:30pm&quot;, &quot;1:48pm&quot;, &quot;2:06pm&quot;, &quot;2:24pm&quot;, &quot;2:42pm&quot;)
nodes &lt;- node_size %&gt;% 
  mutate(id = name,
         label = str_wrap(name, width = 20),
         size = n / 20,
         color = case_when(
           time %in% Shiny_I ~ &quot;lightgreen&quot;,
           time %in% Text_Mining ~ &quot;lightblue&quot;
         ))</code></pre>
<p>for the edge tibble it needs <em>from</em> and <em>to</em> columns that matches with the <em>id</em> in the node tibble. I will also supply with a constant color column (because if omitted it would borrow from the node coloring) and a width column to indicate how many attendees they share. This is again done with a couple of left_joins and the connectivity is the average percentage of attendees they share. Lastly we remove any edge with less then 0.5 connectivity to clear out the graph.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>edges &lt;- conn %&gt;% 
  left_join(node_size %&gt;% 
              dplyr::select(-time) %&gt;% 
              rename(n_from = n), 
                   by = c(&quot;from&quot; = &quot;name&quot;)) %&gt;%
  left_join(node_size %&gt;% 
              dplyr::select(-time) %&gt;% 
              rename(n_to = n), 
                   by = c(&quot;to&quot; = &quot;name&quot;)) %&gt;%
  mutate(n = as.numeric(n),
         n_to = as.numeric(n_to),
         n_from = as.numeric(n_from),
         connectivity = (n / n_from + n / n_to) / 2,
         width = connectivity * 10,
         color = &quot;grey&quot;) %&gt;%
  filter(connectivity &gt; 0.5)</code></pre>
<p>Which yields us with the wonderful graph which show a somehow clear divide between the two blocks.</p>
