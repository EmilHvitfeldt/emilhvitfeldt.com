Hello, my name is Emil Hvitfeldt. Iâ€™m a Research Programmer at University of Southern California. Co-organizer of East Los Angeles R Users Group, and is the author of [Supervised Machine Learning for Text Analysis in R](https://smltar.com/) with my coauthor [Julia Silge](https://juliasilge.com/). My interests include developing tools for natural language processing for machine learning models and the use of colors in data visualizations.
