Invited talk at New York Open Statistical Programming Meetup

Text constitutes an ever-growing part of the data available to us today. However, it is a non-trivial task to transform text, represented as long strings of characters, into numbers that we can use in our statistical and machine learning models. This talk will focus on the {textrecipes} package and its recent advancements in the realm of text preprocessing.
