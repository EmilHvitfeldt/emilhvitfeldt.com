With an ever-increasing amount of textual data is available to us, having a well-thought-out toolchain for modelling is crucial. tidymodels is a recent effort to create a modelling framework that shares the underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures of the tidyverse. textrecipes joined the roster a year ago and provided an exciting bridge to text preprocessing. This talk tells the tale of the package textrecipes; starting with the Github issue that sparked the idea for the package, go over the trials and challenges associated with building a package that heavily integrates with other packages all the way to the release on CRAN.
