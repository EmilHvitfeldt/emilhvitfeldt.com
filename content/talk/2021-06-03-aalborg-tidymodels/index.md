Invited talk at Aalborg RUG

The tidymodels framework is a collection of R packages for modeling and machine learning using tidyverse principles. A large number of packages from preprocessing to evaluation come together to form a coherent framework for doing modeling: statistically, and machine learning-wise. This talk will walk through the landscape of packages and their individual place, helping you get a bird's eye view.
