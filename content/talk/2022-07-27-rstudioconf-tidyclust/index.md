Accepted talk at [rstudio::conf(2022)](https://www.rstudio.com/conference/)

This talk marks the grand introduction of tidyclust, a new package that provides a tidy unified interface to clustering model within the tidymodels framework.

While tidymodels has been a leap forward in making machine learning methods accessible to a general audience in R, it is currently limited to the realm of supervised learning. tidyclust, by Emil Hvitfeldt and Kelly Bodwin, builds upon the interfaces familiar to tidymodels users to make unsupervised clustering models equally approachable.
