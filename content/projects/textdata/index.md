summary: Provides a framework to download, parse, and store text datasets

The goal of textdata is to provide access to text-related data sets for easy access without bundling them inside a package. Some text datasets are too large to store within an R package or are licensed in such a way that prevents them from being included in an OSS-licensed package. Instead, this package provides a framework to download, parse, and store the datasets on the disk and load them when needed.
