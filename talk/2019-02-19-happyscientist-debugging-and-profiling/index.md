Hitting an error or a speed-bump while working in R can be a frustration. This seminar will cover strategies and techniques for performing debugging and code profiling in R. We will look at some different ways to identify bugs, how to fix them and how to prevent them from coming back again. We will also look at a couple of typical patterns seen in slow code and at what can be done to fix it.
