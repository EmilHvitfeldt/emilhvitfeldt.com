There are many palettes available in various R packages. Having a way to explore all of these palettes are already found within the https://github.com/EmilHvitfeldt/r-color-palettes repository and the {paletteer} package.

This talk shows what happens when we take one step further into explorability. Using handcrafted color features, dimensionality reduction, and interactive tools will we create and explore a color palette embedding. In this embedded space will we interactively be able to cluster palettes, find neighboring palettes, and even generate new palettes in a whole new way. The Package in question is: https://github.com/EmilHvitfeldt/palette2vec
