Text constitutes an ever-growing part of the data available to us today. However, it is a non-trivial task to transform text, represented as long strings of characters, into numbers that we can use in our statistical and machine learning models. textrecipes has been around for a couple of years to aid the practitioner in transforming text data into a format that is suitable for machine learning models. This talk gives a brief overview of the basic functionality of the package and a look at exciting recent additions.
