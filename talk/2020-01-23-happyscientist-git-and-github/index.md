Working alone or with other people becomes increasing difficult with the increase of files and people. This seminar goes into detail why and how to use git in collaborative research.
Material in this talk is heavely inspired by [Excuse me, do you have a moment to talk about version control?](https://peerj.com/preprints/3159v2/) by [Jenny Bryan](https://twitter.com/JennyBryan).
