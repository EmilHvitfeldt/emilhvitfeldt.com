This presentation will let you though a lot of different aspects of what you can do in R to make yourself happy, make sure that future you is happy, and avoid getting mad at past you. This presentation will have a quite small focus on the actual R code you will produce by having the focus be on how you interact with the R code itself, touching on topics such as style and reproducibility.
