An ever-increasing amount of textual data is available us. I’ll talk you through a structured way to do exploratory data analysis(also called text mining) using tidytext to gain insight into the plain unstructured text. This will be followed by a demonstration of how modeling strategies can facilitate decision making when you have text as part of your data.
